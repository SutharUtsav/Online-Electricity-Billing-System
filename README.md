Online Electricity Billing System has mainly four users Administration,
consumer of electricity, Electricity Department, UPI Service Provider. 

There is a login page which allows registered used to enter in the 
system. An administrator has permission to add new costumer’s records. Only 
the administration can allow to saw the details of each costumer due to privacy 
issue. Administration generate bill via entering the amount of power 
consumed by consumers.

Electricity consumers can check their own details. They can check their 
bill, so they have idea about how much amount to pay. They can check their 
bill of any month of the current year. They can pay bill via Paytm, BHIM, 
UPI, Credit card, Debit card. After selecting appropriate method of payment, 
new web page will be open where user should enter their details according to 
selection of method of payment. After bill payment done successfully 
“Payment Done” prompt will arrive from system.

There will be some utilities like calculator to calculate amount to pay 
according to consumed power. There is search button to search bill of any 
month of the current year.

Hence-forth in this project we have successfully implemented the
Admin-side & Consumer-side functionality, Admin will add the new 
consumer or delete consumer or update the records of existing consumer. 
Electricity department can change unit per cost and they have control of 
billing related stuff. UPI service provider has details of consumer’s 
payment detail. Now Consumer can generate bill and can pay that 
generated bill.
